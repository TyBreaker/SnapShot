# SnapShot

SnapShot allows you to review the use of computers on your network.  On each computer on which it is installed, it captures screenshots
at your specified frequency and optionally records keystrokes.  I created this to monitor my kids' use of the Internet, given I couldn't
be there with them at all times.
